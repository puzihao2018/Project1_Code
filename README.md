# Project 1
Members: Zihao Pu, Ziqiang Chen, Yihan Shang, Yunhai Zhang, Larry Chen, Jingwei Shi

# Project Requirement
1. Programmed in assembnly language
2. Temperature measurement: using K type thermocouple wire measure temperature between 25 &#8451; to 240 &#8451;
3. Toaster oven control: Using SSR box to control the toast oven
4. User interface and feedback:
   1. Selectable reflow profile parameters, soak tempertarue, soak time, reflow temperature and reflow time
   2. Display temperature, running time, and reflow process current state using an LCD attached to the system
   3. Talk. Using 25Q32 memory chip to talk
   4. Start/stop push botton. Used to start, stop. Independent to reset.
   5. Plot strip chart on PC.
5. EMF8 boards. Must be soldered using toast oven controller.
6. Stop when error. Don't reach 50 &#8451; in 60 second, stop immediately
7. Error range: &#177;3 &#8451;
